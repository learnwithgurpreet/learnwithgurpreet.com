When I was looking for some NodeJS based powerful CMS I found Strapi as a good example since it is not only popular these days but comes with nearly zero bootstrap footprints.

I would like to categorize my article into three main questions which we generally ask whenever we choose a new framework or library.

## What is Strapi?

Strapi is the leading open-source headless CMS that is based on 100% Javascript and fully customizable and developer-first.

## Why Strapi?

I am using WordPress for the past 7 years without any complaint but whenever I install it I have to live with its default data types which take too much time to customize. On top of it, you need to have depth knowledge of how it works if you want to add/remove any field.

On the other hand, if you are using Strapi it offers you to define your own content types and data structure. No matter how many/fewer fields you want in your blog or page, you can define them with ease.

Following are the key features that I do like about Strapi:

> Technical aspect

- Headless CMS
- Easy to install and ship
- Option to choose database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB)
- Markdown-based Rich text editor (Less text to transport)
- Consume API from any REST or GraphQL client

> User experience aspect

- Seamless experience to create/edit and manage content types.
- Runs on NodeJS which makes any JavaScript/NodeJS developer understand.
- Developer Friendly (configure based on your project needs without touching the code).
- Freedom for content editors to manage content through a user-friendly interface.

## My opinion?

After having these many benefits I like to recommend Strapi for small to medium scale projects since it still needs some improvements in order to manage a heavy load of traffic. My opinion is based on some experiments and a hobby project only. Feel free to share your experience.
