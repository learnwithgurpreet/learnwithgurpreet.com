It is early 2026, and Google has fundamentally shifted from offering simple "chatbots" to providing "AI Agents"—tools that don't just talk but actually do things.

## The Core "Brain": Gemini 3

Gemini 3 is the engine behind almost everything Google does. In 2026, it is split into three main "modes" depending on what you need:

- **Gemini 3 Flash (The "Fast" Model)**: Now the default for everyone. It’s incredibly quick and handles daily tasks like summarizing emails, answering questions, and identifying objects in your photos.

- **Gemini 3 Pro (The "Thinking" Model)**: Used for complex logic. If you are coding a website, solving high-level math, or need "Deep Research" (where the AI spends several minutes browsing the web to write a report), this is the one you use.

- **Gemini Nano**: This lives entirely on your phone. It doesn't need the internet, making it perfect for private tasks like summarizing a voice recording or protecting you from scam calls in real-time.

## The Creative Studios: Flow & Nano Banana

These are the specialized tools for when you want to create something visual.

1. Google Flow (AI Filmmaking)

- **What it is**: An all-in-one "orchestration" tool for video. It combines Google’s video model (Veo 3) and music model (Lyria) to help you make actual movies.

- **The Use Case**: You want to make a 30-second trailer for a book you wrote.

- **The Situation**: You describe the scene ("A rainy street in London, 1920s style") and Flow generates the video, the background music, and even the voiceover. It keeps the "characters" looking the same from one shot to the next.

2. Nano Banana (AI Image Editing)

- **What it is**: This is the quirky name for Google's newest image generation model. It is built for speed and "impossible" edits.

- **The Use Case**: Changing your photos without needing Photoshop.

- **The Situation**: You have a photo of yourself at home but want to see how you’d look with a different hairstyle or standing on a beach in Bali. You "doodle" over your hair or the background and tell Nano Banana what to change. It keeps your face perfectly consistent while changing everything else.

## The "Doing" Tools: Agents & Workspace

In 2026, AI has moved into "Agentic" territory, meaning it can take action on your behalf.

3. NotebookLM (The Research Partner)

- **What it is**: You upload your documents, and it becomes an expert on them.

- **The Situation**: You have a 50-page lease agreement. Instead of reading it, you upload it to NotebookLM and ask, "Does this lease allow pets, and what is the notice period for moving out?" It answers only based on that document.

4. AI Mode in Search (The Buyer Agent)

- **What it is**: Google Search no longer just gives you links; it can now help you buy things.

- **The Situation**: You search for "the best hiking boots for wide feet under $150." The AI finds the best pair, checks if they are in stock at a nearby store, and—with the new Universal Commerce Protocol—can even start the checkout process for you.

5. Google Vids & Workspace

- **What it is**: AI inside Docs, Slides, and the new video app, "Vids."

- **The Situation**: You have a boring spreadsheet of sales data. You open Google Vids, and it automatically turns that data into a professional-looking video presentation with a voiceover and charts.
