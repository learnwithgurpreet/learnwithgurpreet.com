For a long time, my camera sat in its bag, a silent witness to the moments I stopped capturing. Life happened, priorities shifted, and that creative spark that used to drive me out of bed at dawn for the perfect light began to flicker and, eventually, fade.

But as 2026 begins, I’ve realized that losing a passion doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. It just means it was waiting for the right season to return.

## A Look Back to Move Forward

The catalyst for this comeback was revisiting my past work. I recently revived my [portfolio website](https://p.learnwithgurpreet.com), and seeing those captured memories reminded me of the "why" behind my art. Every image held a story, a technical challenge overcome, or a quiet emotion frozen in time.

## What’s Next?

2026 isn't about chasing likes or following fleeting trends. It’s about the joy of the process. Whether I’m shooting digital, film, or just experimenting with light, I’m committed to keeping the lens cap off this time.
